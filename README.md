## Biscotti Hubot

This is the bot, known as `mr.wiggles` that lurks in biscotti.

The hubot code is dumped in `hubot/` and is accessible for customization as
desired. When adding a new hubot extension, be sure to either include it in the
Dockerfile install, or add it to `package.json`.

The `docker/` directory contains a quick doc for building docker images to run the
bot, and its redis brain.
