## Biscotti Hubot

This is the bot, known as `mr.wiggles` that lurks in biscotti.

The hubot code is dumped in `hubot/` and is accessible for customization as
desired.

The `docker/` directory contains docs and Dockerfiles for building docker
images to run the bot. Currently, the docker image created will use the stock
hubot code with no customization, but i will work to improve this as
customization is added.
